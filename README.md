# Financiera

This project is a Vue 3 application built with Vite. It includes a dashboard and login screen with animated elements.

## Accessibility

Animations are powered by [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) but they are disabled automatically when the operating system's **Reduce Motion** setting is active. If you want to turn off animations manually, enable the `prefers-reduced-motion` option in your browser or OS settings.
